[color=yellow]— I demand you return my sister! [/color]\n\nA girl in her twenties of poor origins, glares at you with a confident and intimidating look. After a brief explanation, you realize she means Emily, the girl you took off the streets couple of days ago. Despite her clear enmity, she looks fairly attractive, with long auburn hair and gray eyes resembling her sister's. Judging by her looks, she probably works in one of the shops or another service job. She is clearly not rich, but not as badly off as those from the orphanage. As Emily is brought to you, Tisha's face shows a sign of relief.\n\n[color=yellow]— What did you think when you came here?! You don't know what these people are capable of![/color]\n\n"

[/color]\n\nRegardless of her sister's agitations, Emily doesn't flinch.\n\n[color=aqua]— No. I'm not going back to the orphanage! I can stay here, if I want to. You don't even show up once a week and all I am left with is to beg in the streets when we don't have enough to eat. I’m staying here with $name. [/color]\n\nTisha reacts with surprise, but there's some determination left in her.[color=yellow]— Look, I know you have it tough, but so do I. You are my sister and I been working additional jobs to get us enough money to live on. Some that require me to sleep at work.

I'll let people in town know what you did! I have many friends and you'll pay for this if you won't release her![/color]\n\nEven though obviously enraged, Tisha’s threats do not sound too convincing.

var TishaEmilyCompensation = "You let Tisha know, that taking care of Emily wasn't free and you demand compensation for her time spent with you. She looks disgusted, but obviously prepared to offer such a concession. As Emily leaves the room, she approaches you closely. \n\n[color=yellow]— You must have planned this from the very beginning. It this what you want? [/color]\n\nSaying this she crouches and roughly pull down your pants, revealing your manhood. In response you order her not to rush. Tisha understands her position and it seems this isn't new for her; to make a bargain by providing someone with pleasure. She got what she wanted and now it was her turn to pay back. Even though she clearly despises you, her face is mostly resigned, making you wonder how many times she’s had to solve her problems this way. \n\nWith a few confident strokes your penis stands ready and you order Tisha to go for it. In spite of having no interest, she has some skills and pretty face. Her tongue elegantly moves up and down your shaft, while she uses her hands to stimulate you to a quicker orgasm. Despite her hope to end this soon, you take a good ten minutes to enjoy her mouth to its full. \n\nShe swears, as you finally come over her face. You give her some spare clothes and time to clean up before leaving, after which both sisters leave without looking back. " 
var TishaEmilyBrandCompensation = "Due to branding, Emily can be considered your property. You offer Tisha the only obvious solution for her: serve you instead of Emily. Giving her few minutes to think, you order Emily away. Finally, Tisha sees no other choice, but to make deal with you. Before that, however, you decide it would be best for her to submit to you right here, so you order her to give you a blowjob. \n\n[color=yellow]— You must have planned this from the very beginning, you bastard...[/color]\n\nSaying this she crouches and roughly pull down your pants, revealing your manhood.

Despite her hope to end this soon, you take a good ten minutes to enjoy her mouth to its full. \n\nAfter sprouting over Tisha's face and listening to her grunts, you decide this does not exactly satisfy you yet and order her to take off her clothes. After going this far she realizes there's no choice but to go with your demands. Under your stare the older sister reveals her voluptuous body, while still covering her privates and heavily blushing, indicating a plentitude of shame she has left. \n\nAfter savoring the look, you order Tisha to bend over the table, which she reluctantly does. Her striptease was enough to make your cock hard again. You spot her being somewhat wet as you hastily push into her pussy. Surprised by sudden entrance the girl yelps under your weight. Her tight cunt feels just right for you, and as you proceed to move she also gets wetter. Realizing, that this won't be over quickly, Tisha attempts to enjoy this intercourse by closing her eyes and quietly moaning in response to your thrusts. You decide it might be a good idea to build a relationship with your new toy sooner, rather than later. You help the girl to achieve orgasm together with you, as you pull out and cover her ass and back with your semen. \n\nAs Tisha lies breathless, you decide it's a best time to secure your new possession and perform the branding ritual over her, to which she patiently submits."

var TishaEmilyKeepEmily = "You realize, as both sisters are in your possession, there's ultimately no reason (other than reputation), to go with your words and lose any of them. As you declare it, they stare at you in disbelief.\n\n[color=yellow]— No way... You tricked me!? I knew all you rich bastards were like this! [/color]\n\nIt is probably a good idea to keep a close eye on them over the next few weeks."
var EmilyReturn = "In the morning you are surprised by a visit from an old acquaintance - Emily, who seems happy to see you. She briefly explains herself:\n\n[color=yellow]— I talked to my sister and she finally agreed to let me work for you. I guess she thought that if you were going to do something bad with me, you'd done it already, so..."
var EmilyMeet = "In the corner of the street you spot a young girl dressed in ragged clothes. Poverty is widespread about the kingdom, but seeing it first hand still raises some discomfort in you. It does not look like there's many people around, nor anyone paying attention to you, so you decide to start a conversation with her. \n\n[color=yellow]— I'm sorry if I bother you, $sir, but I'm very hungry! Could you spare some food?[/color]"
var EmilyFeed = "After going through your belongings you finally find some bread and meat you had leftover from breakfast, which you pass to her. Emily takes your offering with an excited look and quickly expresses her gratitude. While she eats, you decide to spend some time with her and ask about her life, deciding it could be useful to get a better understanding of the city. \n\n[color=yellow]— I've been living in the orphanage since before I can remember... I have a sister but she left a few years ago. She now tries to earn some money for us to live on so we rarely see each other anymore. Oh, m-my name is Emily... [/color]"
var EmilyTake = "You explain to Emily how you recently moved in and could use some help around the mansion. You can provide her with food and shelter if she won't mind following your orders. Not quite believing your words, she looks at you with wide open eyes. After few moments she responds.\n\n[color=yellow]— You would allow me? Thank you $sir... $master! I'll do my best![/color]\n\nSealing an agreement, you give Emily directions to your mansion and she leaves. "

Seemingly unaware of your plans, Emily disappears into the bathroom. \n\nA quarter of an hour later, you, being sure, that the aphrodisiac should've taken effect, take a small peek. With a grin, you discover Emily sitting naked on the board, red in the face, squeezing her thighs while her fingers explores her privates. Quickly undressing yourself, you slip into the bathroom unnoticed, and approach Emily playing innocent. \n\n[color=yellow]— $master! I'm not…[/color]\n\nThe orphan girl seems to be completely shocked at your unannounced presence, her face getting even redder. Judging by the fact she is not screaming or trying to escape, you decide, that she can't make up her mind on how to react, and quickly take things into your own hands. With a gentle, yet accusing voice, you tell her, that you appreciate her arousal, but she can't just do what she pleases in her $master's home. Catching Emily in your trap, you make her believe that her behavior is entirely her own will and her lust is based off of her desires.\n\nSeeing Emily accepting your manipulative words, you wrap your arm about her in an embrace, meeting no resistance. Despite being overwhelmed by the new situation, the aphrodisiac pumps through her veins and the orphan girl begins to awkwardly respond to your actions. As you greedily suck on her month, your hand hastily covers her soaking crotch, joining her own hand. With small push, Emily shyly spreads her legs apart, giving you easier access. Stimulating her pussy, you slide a finger into her to discover she's clearly still a virgin, although that possibility had  already crossed your mind. \n\nAs she gets wetter and her moans get louder, you lay her on the bench and without further delay push your erect cock inside. The brief look of pain on her face is quickly washed away by pleasure as you begin to move within her. With every push the look on her face becomes more and more blissful, as she leans forward  trying to hug you. A few moments later she orgasms and feeling of her convulsions lead you to your own climax, filling her with hot seed. As you pull out, a stream of semen mixed with blood slowly seeps from her hard-breathing body. \n\nAfter helping her clean up, you leave the bathroom and get dressed once more.A few minutes later, she emerges from the bathroom red faced. She averts her eyes as you look at her, but as you don't spot any negative feelings towards you. You leave her to get accustomed with her new role. "
var EmilyShowerRape = "After few minutes, you noticed that Emily is finished with shower and is preparing to get dressed. You rush into the dressing room and roughly push her against the wall. Shocked by your entrance, Emily tries to protest, but your hand closes over her mouth. While your other hand lecherously savours her body, you let her know, that even if she yells, nobody is going to come to her rescue, and her resistance will only make things worse. Tears begin to swell up in her eyes, but her attitude quickly reveals she understands her position.\n\nWith her acceptance, you decide to make the most of this little affair and grab her small boobs squeezing them forcefully. Pulling on her nipples with clear intent to cause some pain, you delightly listen to small cries and observe her pained expression. Holding her squirming body, you push into her pussy, quickly meeting the resistance of her hymen. Pausing before you break through you roughly rub her. Despite her pleading she begins to gets mildly wet at your administrations, which makes you grin. \n\nYou bend her over and push her against the wall. Emily sobs seemingly preparing for what she knows comes next. \n\n[color=yellow]— Please stop, I don’t want this![/color]\n\nGrabbing her ass, you force your hard cock inside her virgin pussy in one thrust making her cry out in pain, as it tears through the slight resistance of her hymen. You pause, giving her barely enough time to recover, before resuming without any further concern for her well-being. Since she's not going to enjoy it anyway, you decide it's only humane to focus on your objective. Accompanied by her sobs and cries, you mercilessly fuck her tight pussy until you finally climax deep inside of her torn privates. \n\nLeaving her sobbing on the floor, your come mixed with blood oozing from her abused pussy, you advise her to take another shower.Satisfied you make your way out of bathroom."
var EmilyMansion = "After returning back you spot Emily seemingly struck in awe over your possession. Deciding her looks are not quite suitable for your establishment, you instruct her to freshen up and find something suitable in the wardrobe. \n\n[color=yellow]— Ah!

var EmilyMansion2 = "After an hour a renewed Emily finds you. It seems she managed to find something right for her size and with some side help even managed to fix her appearance.

I'm sorry, but I think Tisha is gone. I was visiting her yesterday, but she wasn't at her workplace. Her boss said she's been missing for two days and nobody really can tell where she is. If it won't bother you, please help me find her, I hope nothing bad happened to her.

var TishaDisappearAgree = "[color=yellow]— Thank you, $master, I knew you would help me out![/color]\n\nEmily looks greatly relieved by your words and gives you information on where Tisha lives and works. Apparently she was employed by the Order in last few days before her disappearance.  "
var TishaDisappearDeny = "You tell Emily that you are a busy person and she'd better ask for city guards to help with that. Although chances of them helping out someone like her are very slim. Emily retreats with a sore look and leaves you to your business. "
var TishaDisappearUnlock = "You tell Emily that this kind of stuff might be very dangerous, and putting yourself into trouble for someone you barely know is not very beneficial to you. As she is about to despair, you pretend to consider helping her and finally tell her, that you might be able to help, if you get something from her in return. Emily gives you a troubled look, but after long pause her worrying gets better of her. \n\n[color=yellow]— Alright, I will trust you. I'll do what you ask if it will help Tisha.

This place is used to store massive amounts of paperwork related to city's everyday life. n\n\nA tall, disinterested man briefly responds to your questions trying to get back to his work. He doesn’t bother to hide his irritation with you, and only shares what little he knows when it’s clear you won’t leave him in peace.\n\n[color=yellow]— Ah, that girl? Haven't seen her since yesterday morning. She was assigned to register newcomers. No idea what she's thinking about since she was only hired recently. Yeah, she also got a place in the dorms, you could try check that out, I suppose. She’s missed two shifts now, so if you do see her tell her she’s fired.

After trying to get any useful information out of her, you realize that she evidently knows something. However, she she also seems quite nervous about actually explaining anything."

I didn't think anything could really happen to her, I told him about her daily routine and when she comes back, and I thought he might be some sort of admirer of hers, or even flirting with me... But then she didn't came back and I thought she might be hanging out with him... I was afraid that I would be held responsible for her disappearance. Please, I meant her no harm!

She fit the bill and was an easy target since she was running around town all the time. I don't really know who the guy was, but he had couple guards with him, so probably a merchant.

She resides in dark, medium sized cell, and judging from the spark in her eye, hasn’t lost her spirit yet. It’s easy to admire her composure as she probably contemplating how it would be possible for her to break free later on. \n\nAt first, she doesn’t recognize you, but soon realization strikes her and she looks at you with shock and surprise. Whatever she might think of seeing you here, the gag in her mouth prevents her from sharing. You still have to buy her way out, so you decide not to show that you know, or are even interested in her since that would just drive up the price.The guide still suspects something, though. \n\n[color=yellow]— This one is still rough around the edges, so I'd only recommend her to experienced owners, but probably you wouldn't have too many troubles with her. Still she's quite attractive and uncommon for these lands, so naturally price will be hefty. 800 gold at minimum.

In less than minute you can clearly see how she lost in pleasure and her rising gasps and cries lose any sort of pattern. \n\nAs her actions become wilder and wilder, you can't help but move closer to orgasm. Finally, as she lets out her highest cry, her convulsions bring you to orgasm, filling her thirsty womb with your seed.

We lived way out in the forest away from everyone else. After they captured me, I wasn’t really able to pay attention to where they were dragging me.[/color]\n\nShe seems somewhat irritated, though not at you.\n\n[color=yellow]—I could find my way back if I came by some of the places I used to scout and play before. [/color]\n\nCali seems somewhat embarrassed by her explanation, and you reassure her that you’ll see if you can find some sort of clue about where she was taken from. Perhaps you could ask around in nearby villages if they’ve been having any problems with bandits lately.\n\n[color=green]Cali's opinion of your improved.[/color]"
var CaliVillageEnter1 = "Upon entering the village, you notice a cluster of people gathered around the town well talking fearfully amongst themselves. Some of them are complaining that bandits have been stealing their livestock and attacking lone travelers, while an old man is asking if anyone has seen his granddaughter.\n\nYou approach the villagers and ask what’s going on. They start peppering you with stories of how their farms are being raided by a group of bandits that seems to have taken residence in the area. When you offer to look into it, they promise to give you a reward if you can put a stop to the attacks.\n\nYou walk over to the old man and ask what this is about his granddaughter being missing. He seems a little nervous to be talking to a mage, but answers you.\n\n[color=yellow]—Well, $sir, my granddaughter Tia was out picking berries in the wilds yesterday and she didn’t come home like she was supposed to. When I went out to go look for her, I found her basket but there was no sign of her. Please $sir, with all the recent attacks I’m worried that she got taken by a group of bandits. If you can find her I can’t tell you how grateful I’d be. She’s just a sweet young thing and I don’t want to think of what might happen to her.[/color]\n\nYou ask him to tell you where he found her basket and he describes the location to you.\n\nAfter considering what you’ve found out from the old man and the villagers you decide to see if you can track down this group of bandits."
var CaliPoisonBandits = "As you consult with your leading companion - $name, $he mentions that $he saw some poisonous berries nearby and offers to try to poison the mead barrel. You accept, and warn $him to be careful. $He stealthily moves off into the woods. A few minutes later, the bandits that are drinking are distracted by a sound and start poking around the brush. You see $name quickly sneak up to where the bandits left their mugs, adding something to each. As $he disappears back into the forest you admire $his skilled woodcraft, startled when $he pops up behind you. As you watch the bandits resume their drinking, and it does not take long before they start acting oddly. One lies down and apparently goes to sleep, while the other starts throwing up into the bushes before collapsing."
var CaliDominateBandits = "When the sentry wanders near your position, you quietly cast the Domination spell on him. With glazed eyes he listens as you tell him to start a fight with the two bandits arguing over the girl and try to kill them.\n\nIn a monotone voice he replies 'Yes Master' and goes over to where the bandits’ argument is growing noisier. You can’t make out exactly what is said, but suddenly the bandit you dominated draws a dagger and stabs one of the other bandits in the stomach. The other curses and draws his sword, making short work of the bandit under your command." 
var CaliBanditCampVictory = "You look around the camp in disgust. You meant to leave at least one of the bandits alive for questioning, but were too caught up in the moment to remember. Turning your attention to their captive, you have to admit they at least had good taste. The girl is very pretty and looks at you nervously. After you ungag her, the first thing she does is thank you.\n\n[color=yellow]—Are...are you here to rescue me? I was sure I was about to be raped and sold as a slave. [/color]\n\nYou explain that you were actually trying to hunt down the bandits for information, but got a bit too caught up in the matter. After you tell her this, she nods slowly and hesitantly offers to tell you what she overheard.\n\n[color=yellow]—I’m not sure how much help this is, but I heard one of the bandits talking about about a slaver camp in the crossroads. They mentioned that their boss went off to explain to the slaver why they didn’t have the wolf-girl they promised to deliver. Some of the bandits were worried that the boss would kill them if they didn’t come up with enough loot by the time he got back and hoped he would be distracted by me. That’s...that’s all I know. Please, could you take me home? I live in Shaliq village and I’m sure my grandpa would reward you for bringing me back...[/color]\n\nA thought comes to mind as you consider what you’ve heard. From what it sounds like, this was, in fact the same group that captured Cali, and it looks like you’ll need to visit that slaver camp to get any more information. You could return the girl to her grandfather and you’re sure you’d probably get a nice bonus in addition to the bounty for killing the bandits. On the other hand, the girl is very pretty and you could just say you never found her."
var CaliReturnGirl = "Deciding you’d rather gamble on the generosity of the girl’s grandfather, you agree to take her home. It’s getting late, so you merely drop her off in Shaliq on the way back to your mansion, promising to return in the morning for your promised reward."
var CaliKidnapGirl = "After considering the matter, you decide whatever few coins the villagers could scrape up are nothing in comparison to the value in taking this girl as a slave. Without further hesitation you swiftly knock the girl unconscious and return to the mansion, dropping her off in your jail. "
var CaliSeduceGirl = "Casting the Entrancement spell, you begin talking to Tia, explaining how she’s better off as your servant, how her grandfather clearly can’t protect her and how very pretty you think she is. It takes only a short while for her to agree and she follows you the the mansion, convinced by the effects of your spell."
var CaliVillageEnter2 = "When you return to Shaliq, several of the villagers gather round and ask if you’ve had any luck with the bandits. You regale them with the story of how you and your companion cleared out a group of the scum hiding in the wilds. When Tia’s grandfather asks if you had any luck finding his granddaughter, you apologize and tell him that there was no sign of her. He walks off sadly while the rest of the village buys you a round of drinks at the bar, asking you to retell the story over and over. Finally, one of the men approaches you with a small bag of gold.\n\n[color=yellow]—Here, It’s not much, but we all pitched in. Thank you for getting rid of those bandits for us.[/color]\n\nWhen you open the bag and see the measly 50 gold you think to yourself that taking the girl was the right move. After all, it’s not like these country bumpkins would have had any real money. Still, you thank the men and head back to your mansion. You should probably let Cali know what you’ve found out so far."
var CaliVillageEnter3 = "As you enter the village of Shaliq, there’s an immediate cheer when you’re spotted. Apparently they’ve already heard what happened from the girl you rescued. Not much of a surprise there since you just dropped her off at the inn before you went of. Suddenly, you’re almost knocked off your feet by a very enthusiastic hug - more a tackle, to be honest. You realize it’s the girl you rescued and see her grandfather beaming at you.\n\n[color=yellow]—I can’t thank you enough for what you’ve done. Tia told us everything. I can’t believe you and your companion managed to take out more than twice your own numbers in bandits, let alone save my granddaughter in the process. We took up a collection last night to reward you. Here, please take it.[/color]\n\nOpening the bag, you’re stunned to see what must be over 300 golds. This has to represent the savings of nearly everyone in the village."
var CaliVillageAcceptReward = "You close the bag and shake your head. It’s really too much, but you don’t want to scoff at the generous offering. You thank the men, shaking several hands and get another hug from Tia before you return to your mansion. Now you just need to let Cali know what you’ve learned so far."
var CaliVillageRefuseReward = "You close the bag and hand it back with a bit of regret. You tell the villagers it’s really too much and that honestly, you weren’t doing it for the reward. They should save the money for when the village has a poor harvest. The looks you get back are equal parts stunned and admiring. Finally one of the burly men from the crowd speaks up.\n\n[color=yellow]—That’s downright generous of you $sir. I’m sure we’ll find a use for the money, but I think I’m speakin for everyone when I say we can’t just let you go without some kind of reward. We can help you out with some materials you could use for your estate.[/color]\n\nSeeing the rest of the crowd in agreement, you shake your head ruefully and agree to let them do some sprucing up. While that’s being done, you think it’s time you let Cali know what you’ve learned so far.\n\n[color=green]Your communal room take 2 more persons now.[/color]"
var CaliTalk2 = "When you greet Cali, she immediately asks if you’ve learned anything new and you explain that while you haven’t found out much about her parents, you’ve learned of a slaving operation near the crossroad. Further, that the leader of the group that captured her seems to have went there. Since you killed the other bandits, you tell her that your only hope of finding more information on where she was taken from is to infiltrate the camp and try to get close to the bandits’ boss.\n\n[color=yellow]—Ya know, there might be a way I could help you get in. If we pretend like you captured me and were bringing me to the slaver you might be able to get into the camp without attracting suspicion.[/color]\n\nYou pause and think about it for a moment."
var CaliTalk2Accept = "You warn her it might be dangerous, but if she’s willing, it might make things easier. She has a serious expression on her face as she replies.[color=yellow]\n\n—I know it’s a bit risky, but I want to help out since this involves me in first place. I can act pretty persuasively too. [/color]"
var CaliTalk2Refuse = "You shake your head and tell her that it’s too risky. If the bandit boss sees her there it might make him suspicious. She seems a bit put out by you declining her offer, but says she understands and that she’ll wait here until you’ve gotten the information."
var CaliBarEntrance = "You decide to visit a local bar in attempt to find some clues about Cali's origins. After few minutes of casual talk the barkeeper points you in a few directions. Following them leads you to one ruthless looking man who seems to deal in slave trafficking, however Cali does not recognize him. You decide to talk to him directly. After brief introduction he tells you to call him Jason.\n\n[color=yellow]— Halfkin slavers? Well, I could name a place or two, but what's in it for me? You seem to be in a rush though and I think, I know exactly who you would be looking for. [/color]\n\nTelling him to get to the point, he proposes a deal.\n\n[color=yellow]— 500 gold. Semi-legal slavers have their own fears and who knows;  you might be one of those  Militia dogs sniffing out an easy promotion. Or... — He gives Cali a dirty look making her feel uncomfortable. — I wouldn't mind having some fun with your girl, she's pretty cute and I really like that rebellious look. Obviously she wouldn't worth this much, but that would be enough proof of your good will, right? I'll tell you what you want for 100 gold then. [/color]"
var CaliBarRepeat = "You enter the same bar and find your previous acquaintance slowly drinking at one of the tables. \n\n[color=yellow]— You again? Did you get the money? Remember, no money no info. Or did you persuaded your girl for a discount? [/color]\n\nCali looks at Jason with uneasiness."

var CaliBarForce = "You explain to Cali, that 400 gold is a huge sum of money you don't have on hand and it's essentially her duty to do anything she can to help find her parents. Having sex with this man is a small price for their well-being. \n\nAfter long moment of silence she sighs and agrees with pained look on her face. \n\n[color=yellow]— You are right... This is like a horrible dream. Fine, I'll do it.[/color]\n\nWith her confirmation you return to the mercenary. "
var CaliBarDeny = "As you drop the issue, Cali sighs with relief. There's likely some other ways to deal with Jason without involving her. "
var CaliBarPersuadeSuccess = "You explain to Cali how you would like her to take this as an opportunity to learn new things and overcome her shyness. There should be no danger and they also get a nice bonus helping her own cause.\n\nShe's taken back by your suggestion, but you notice some curiosity and budding lust in her eyes. \n\n[color=yellow]— Y-you think so? I... wouldn't want to do this, but if you want me... Alright. I will have sex with him.[/color]\n\nYou smile back at her, satisfied with her decisiveness and prepare to return to the mercenary."
var CaliBarPersuadeFail = "[color=yellow]— NO!! I won't stay alone with that man in same room even for 1 minute! Why are you even suggesting this?? I can't believe you would want me to have sex with him![/color]"
var CaliBarFuckUnwilling = "After passing Cali a contraception, you send them off to one of the Bar's private rooms. After what feels like a couple of hours they finally show up again. Jason wears a smug, satisfied grin, while Cali's face appears red from recent tears. You spot couple of bruises on her body, indicating she probably tried to struggle.\n\n[color=yellow]— She's nice and tight, but you should really discipline her better. Alright, 100 gold and I tell you everything you want. [/color]"
var CaliBarFuckWilling = "After passing Cali a contraception, you send them off to one of the Bar's private rooms. After what feels like a couple of hours they finally show up again. Jason has a greatly satisfied look on his face. Cali looks fairly tired, disheveled and sways slightly while walking, but otherwise there's no uneasiness on her face. It seems they found a common language.\n\n[color=yellow]— I haven't had such fun in quite a while, you got a one amazing girl for her age, Pal. Ya know, keep the gold, I'll tell you what you want.[/color]\n\nAfter getting the slaver camp location, you tell him goodbye and return back to Mansion with Cali."
var CaliBarAskSebastian = "After describing your situation to the Sebastian, you ask him if he could help somehow.\n\n[color=yellow]— Oh, Jason, you say? Yes, yes, I know him. Pretty reliable guy when it comes to work, but he's not in the business just for money. You probably have figured it out already though. — He gives Cali a quick glance, — Well, I assume you came to me so the young lady wouldn't need to deal with something nasty like his offer. Truth to be told, he owes me a favor since the time I let him... well, you don't really need to know about that. \n\n— Take this note, he should recognize it and at least cut a hefty sum from his service. Oh, don't worry about it, after all you helped me before, and I expect us to have profitable partnership in the future. It's only pleasure to forge a friendship with person of your caliber![/color]\n\nAfter taking the debt note from Sebastian, you leave and can visit Jason again. "

Fine $name, 100 gold and I'll tell you everything. [/color]\n\nAfter hearing this Cali is relieved, not worrying about having to deal with him anymore. "
var CaliSlaversTaken = "As you look around the Crossroads, you notice what seems to be a collection of tents and cages, set back from the road a bit and fenced off except for an opening guarded by a pair of rough-looking sentries. When you approach, their bored expressions vanish and they look at you with suspicion.\n\n[color=yellow]— Hold up there. This is a private encampment, unless you have business here you should be on your way.[/color]\n\nYou tug a lead and Cali stumbles out from behind you, dressed in a scruffy tunic. Before coming here, you managed to convince her the only way you’d be taken seriously was if she really did look like a prisoner. She wasn’t exactly thrilled with the idea, but agreed as long as you made her bindings loose enough that she could slip out of them quickly.\n\nUpon seeing the half-kin girl one of the sentries smirks, while the other starts looking bored again. You explain that you heard that there was a slaver here that was interested in half-kin girls and wanted to see if you could make some gold.\n\n[color=yellow]— Yeah, guess you heard right. Alright, show her to the boss. — He jerks a thumb behind him. — Look for the red tent near the center of the encampment.[/color]\n\nYou notice Cali bristling at the dismissive tone and shoot her a warning look before thanking the guard and heading in. Despite its small size, the encampment is crowded with tents and cages. You can hear the sounds of whips and screams in the background and you can see Cali’s eyes widen as she sees a pair of half-kin catgirls naked and covered in welts in a one of the nearby cages.\n\nYou finally manage to locate the red tent the guard mentioned and walk inside. You are immediately greeted by the sight of a corpulent man dressed in gaudy clothes, scribbling on some papers at a table.\n\n[color=red]— What is it? I told you not to bother me again today![/color]\n\nHe doesn’t bother looking up. Clearing your throat, you try to get the man’s attention. After a minute the man looks up, seeming surprised.\n\n[color=red]— Huh, you’re not who I thought you were. Forget it, what’s your business with me?[/color]"
var CaliSlaversLeft = "As you look around the Crossroads, you notice what seems to be a collection of tents and cages, set back from the road a bit and fenced off except for an opening guarded by a pair of rough-looking sentries.

This is a private encampment, unless you have business here you should be on your way.[/color]\n\nYou explain that you heard you might be able to purchase some exotic slaves here and wanted to see what was available. One of the sentries spits and looks away, clearly uninterested. The other one gives you clothing a measuring look and replies.\n\n[color=yellow]— Maybe, but we don’t just let anyone in here.

var CaliSlaversPay = "The guard carefully counts out the money then jerks a thumb back towards the center of the camp.\n\n[color=yellow]— You want to look for the red tent near the center. If you’re here to buy you’ll need to speak to the boss. He’s been in a foul mood lately though, so watch yourself.[/color]\n\nAs you enter the camp it’s clear this is a fairly large operation. There’s tents and cages throughout the cramped space and the sound of whips, cursing and screams fill the air. The smell isn’t exactly pleasant either and a quick glimpse at one of the cages shows one of the reasons. Inside is a young half-kin girl, huddled in a fetal position and covered in her own filth. Other cages have more of the same, the few occupants that dare meet your eyes look at you with fear.\n\nYou finally manage to locate the red tent the guard mentioned and walk inside.

Were you looking to sell her?[/color]\n\nYou shrug and tell him she’s been nothing but trouble and that you’d heard there was someone here that might find her worthwhile. Even though you’d warned Cali you might do this, she still seems a bit worried. Your trip through the camp must have made an impression on her.\n\nThe man steps closer, ponderously making his way around her. After a minute or two he nods to himself.\n\n[color=red]— Well, she’s not much to look at. She seems like she has some spirit in her though, that might make her entertaining to break. If you want to sell her I suppose I could offer 350 gold for her.[/color]\n\nYou find yourself surprisingly tempted by the offer. You’re sure that if you sold Cali at the slave market you’d get far less so this is actually a rather good price."
var CaliSlaverSell = "When you agree to the offer, Cali looks shocked for a moment then starts to struggle with her bonds while shouting.\n\n[color=yellow]— You fucking bastard, I knew I couldn’t trust you![/color]\n\nYou put a quick stop to her nonsense with a quick jerk to the lead running to her hands. She apparently never noticed the knot you tied was actually a slipknot, and your yank simultaneously draws the bindings tight and knocks her off balance. The slaver just watches with interest as you quickly subdue the struggling wolf-girl. After she’s been thoroughly hog-tied you tell the slaver to keep a close eye on her and that she’s already escaped from one set of captors before. The slaver just smiles, an evil glint in his eye as he replies.\n\n[color=red]— Oh, trust me, I know just how to deal with a girl like her. First I’ll spend some time beating her so she knows her place, then I’ll pass her around to be raped a few times. If any of my men aren’t pleased, she’ll be beaten again. Of course if it looks like she’s too badly injured, I’ll just have to heal her. After a few days she’ll be begging to please every man in the camp.[/color]\n\nAfter you heard the man mention he’d heal her, you instinctively looked to see if the man was wearing a distinctive ring. Seeing it, you nod to yourself. The man counts up your gold from a small chest behind the table and hands it to you.\n\n[color=red]— Ah, and if you’re ever in the market for an animal, stop by again. I may have something to interest you. Here, let me give you my token so that the guards know that you are welcome here.[/color]"

You explain that you had recently been by Shaliq village, where you overheard an interesting tidbit in the local inn.

Of course if I find a lynch mob from Shaliq coming my way I’ll make sure you suffer for it. How about I give you a discount on buying slaves from me in the future?

It’s a shame you couldn’t get here sooner, but what’s done is done.\n\nEventually, she looks up at you, eyes puffy from crying.\n\n[color=yellow]— I...what do I do now? They’re dead and I’m….I’m all alone now.[/color]\n\nYou consider the matter. At this point she’s particularly vulnerable to your suggestions and there are a number of things you could do with her."

Finally, the truth sinks in and she collapses, sobbing from the bottom of her heat as she admits to the fact of her parent’s deaths.\n\nEventually, she looks up at you, eyes puffy from crying.\n\n[color=yellow]— I...what do I do now?

var CaliStay = "You tell her that that’s fine and that she can stay with you for as long as she wants. She gives you a grateful look, then scrubs her eyes.\n\nAfter several hours you bury her parents and return to the mansion. It may not have been a happy conclusion, but Cali seems to appreciate what you’ve done for her. After the death of her parents, she seems to have lost some of her confidence and assertiveness, but her faith in you has grown a lot  and she seems willing to do whatever you ask of her."
var CaliSlave = "You think for a while, while Cali seems to grow more nervous. Finally you tell her that if she is willing to swear absolute servitude to you, you’ll consider it. If she promises that she will be obedient, won’t cause any trouble and will do anything you ask of her, you will offer her a place in your household. She swallows, then nods.[color=yellow]— I’ll be a good servant...$master.[/color]\n\nIt may not have been a happy conclusion, but Cali seems to understand her place. After the death of her parents, she seems to have lost some of her confidence and assertiveness becoming more passive that she used to be. She has become one of your more obedient servants, never forgetting that you are now her Master."
var CaliPlaythingSuccess = "You finger the Amnesia Potion you found in the bandit leader’s camp, then withdraw it. You tell Cali that if the pain is too much to bear, there’s something she could do. She listens, then looking over at the bodies she nods.\n\n[color=yellow]— I...if it will make me forget all this. I’ll do it. From the beginning I guess I was just going to end up as someone’s plaything. I’d rather it be you than someone else. Just...promise you won’t throw me away.[/color]\n\nYou nod and Cali takes the potion from you. Closing her eyes she drinks the potion down in a rush. As she opens her eyes, the empty bottle slips from her fingers to the grass below. Her empty eyes and blank expression are all you need to confirm the impact of the potion.\n\n[color=yellow]— Who are you?[/color]\n\nYou explain that you are her Master and that she belongs to you.\n\n[color=yellow]— What are we doing here Master?[/color]Smiling, you take her hand and lead her away from the corpses. While you walk, you explain that you brought her out here to explain her her duties and teach her what pleases you. After you are a ways away, you tell her to remove her clothing, to which she immediately complies. As she stands naked before you, you tell her her sole purpose in life is to bring you pleasure with her body. For the next several hours you instruct her in how to pleasure you with her hands and mouth, with her pussy and her ass, until her body is stained in your semen and your seed trickles down her thighs. \n\nCali is left a broken mess, more animal than human. Nothing remains of her old personality and all she knows is how to serve her master with her body."
var CaliPlaythingFailure = "She looks at you in shock and revulsion.\n\n[color=yellow]— My parents are dead and you...you want me to become your plaything?[/color]\n\nWithout another word she takes off, never looking back. You shrug as she disappears into the woods. It’s a shame, but she was never that loyal to begin with. You poke around the ruins for time, hoping to find something the bandits left behind. Pocketing the few trinkets you happen across, you return to your mansion."
var CaliLeave = "You look around the scene. The burned house, the dead bodies of her parents and the half-kin girl you spent all this effort for. At that moment you decide it. That’s it. You’re done. You did what you said you would and helped Cali find her parents. It’s not your fault they’re dead and you’ve wasted enough time and effort already. Without saying another word, you leave the girl to her own devices. She can be a thief or a whore for all you care. All you know is that your part in this is over."
var CaliGoodEnd = "As you approach a clearing in the forest you come across a lone house. Apparently Cali has been already spotted by her parents as two figures left the build and rushing to the returning girl. A beastkin male and human female with which Cali share some resemblances. \n\n[color=aqua]— Cali! You’re alive, thank the gods! We thought we’d lost you.[/color]\n\nAs they finally gather and reach each other, the three of them share a long hug. After they part, the man looks at you, then back to Cali.\n\n[color=aqua]— So Cali, who’s this person?[/color]\n\nCali looks over at you and grins, tail wagging furiously.\n\n[color=yellow]Mom, Dad, this is $name. He’s been letting me stay at his mansion and he helped me find my way back.[/color]\n\nThe man and woman both give you an appraising look. After a moment, the woman raises an eyebrow and looks at Cali.\n\n[color=green]— So you’ve been taking care of our daughter? I hope she hasn’t been too much trouble.[/color]\n\nYou assure her that Cali’s been fine, and proceed to explain all that’s happened while Cali was missing. Both of her parents seems impressed, and pleased that you managed to help her find her way home.\n\n[color=aqua]— That’s quite the tale. Escaping from slavers, being rescued from the city guards, then this young fellow managed to track us down after taking out an entire gang of bandits. Not to mention getting here just in the nick of time. Is there anything we can do to repay you?[/color]"
var CaliGoodEndNoReward = "You shake your head and explain that you were just keeping your promise. Seeing Cali reunited with her family is reward enough. Her parents seem impressed with your probity and tell you that if there’s anything their family can do for you in the future, all you need to do is ask. You leave Cali and her family to clean up from the bandit’s attack and feel a sense of satisfaction from a good deed accomplished. "
var CaliGoodEndNoRewardReturn = "It’s been a week since you returned Cali to her parents, and as you settle in for the night you think about the young half-kin girl. Sure, she might not have been the most beautiful girl you’ve met, but she was brave, hardworking and outspoken, traits that are all too uncommon. Suddenly you hear a bit of a commotion from downstairs. You head down, then blink in surprise.\n\n[color=yellow]— Um...hi $name. I was wondering, well...It’s just...I mean, I talked to my parents about it and...Argh! Why is this so hard![/color]Cali takes a deep breath then meets your eyes squarely.\n\n[color=yellow]— I think I love you, $name and I want to stay with you. I don’t mind being your servant, or even your slave. I know I’m not very experienced, but I’ll do anything you ask me to. I’ll fight for you, or gather food or...or bear children for you. Please...just let me stay with you.[/color]\n\nYou smile and ruffle the hair on Cali’s head. You’re glad she’s back and tell her so. As Cali follows you back up to your room, you grin. After all, she did say she’d do anything."
var CaliGoodEndReward = "You tell Cali’s parents that if they really want to reward you, anything would be fine. After all, you were mainly doing this as a favor to Cali. It’s not like you expected a reward. After some consultation amongst themselves Cali’s mother goes into the house. A few minutes later she returns.\n\n[color=green]— I know it’s not much after what you’ve gone through, but here.[/color]\n\nShe hands you a small case. Inside is a number of carefully labeled potions.\n\n[color=green]— My father was an alchemist and he left me with a number of useful potions. Maybe these can be of use to you.[/color]\n\nYou thank her, and give Cali’s hair a ruffle. When you get home, you’ll take a look, but for now you just say your goodbyes. Cali and her mother both give you hugs, while her father shakes your hand and promises never to forget what you’ve done for them. When you eventually return to your mansion you inspect the potions Cali’s mother gave you. You can tell a couple of them are expired, but there’s actually a rather good assortment. There’s a couple of stimulant potions, three tonics of hair growth, an elixir of youth and perhaps most impressive, a potion of oblivion. You’ll miss having Cali around, but are pleased that you could manage to keep your promise to her."
var CaliGoodEndKeep = "You think to yourself for a while. You’re happy that Cali was reunited with her family, but will miss having her services in the mansion. Despite her snark, she was actually pretty useful to have around. Nodding to yourself you ask if they would mind if Cali continued to work for you. If she’s willing, you promise that you’ll let her visit whenever she wants.\n\n[color=aqua]— Well Cali, it’s up to you. What do you think?[/color]\n\nCali looks at her parents then shrugs.\n\n[color=yellow]— I don’t mind working for $name, I mean, that’s what I was doing before anyway. And, well, I guess I do owe $him for all this.[/color]\n\nShe turns to you and gives you a wink.\n\n[color=yellow]— Let me just spend some time catching up with my parents and I’ll come back to the mansion, kay? I know you’ve probably got some [/color][color=pink]work[/color][color=yellow] for me to do when I get back[/color]\n\nCheeky brat. She actually wanted to come back and that wink and look she gave you tells you just what sort of “work” she has on her mind. A few hours after your return, Cali shows up at the door.\n\n[color=yellow]— Hey, I’m back and I’m ready to do whatever you want me to...$master.[/color]"
var CaliProposal = "As you are about to move to the bed, you spot Cali near your room, who apparently was waiting for you. She looks rather nervous but after seeing you, she seems to gather her courage and approaches you. \n\n[color=yellow]— H-hey, I've been waiting for you. I wanted to thank you for taking care of me and also not letting that guy at the bar do anything to me. I never did anything like that with anyone, and that was kinda scary when he asked for it. I mean, I want to try it someday, but not like that... [/color]\n\nCali suddenly becomes quiet with her face getting redder as you observe her. Finally she finds the right words.\n\n[color=yellow]— I actually wanted to say, that I've been thinking a lot about you lately, $name. There wasn't anyone who cared for me like you, besides my parents. I think, I really like you, and... well...[/color]\n\nYou can't help but appreciate her boldness despite how obviously ashamed she is. You decide that it's a time to stop the girl torturing herself over you."
var CaliAcceptProposal = "You tilt your head forward due to Cali's small stature and connect your lips to hers, giving her, her first adult kiss. As your lips touch, her ears twitch and pupils widen, until she decides to close her eyes. While gently savoring her delicate mouth, you decide that at this point it would be better to move into your bedroom. You give Cali a small sign and the wolfgirl obediently enters your chambers. You close the door behind her, to make sure nobody will interrupt your intimacy.\n\n[color=yellow]— Wow, that's a huge bed. I think my mom and dad's was smaller at home. Oh, sorry, sometimes I get distracted easily. Um... what should I do... $master?[/color]\n\nAn unusual, submissive word from Cali makes you smirk at the thought of her trying to please you. As you sit down on the bed, you motion the wolfgirl to join you. She readily complies moving towards you. Sitting next to each other you take initiative and return to what you recently stopped on the other side of the door. As you gently ease your tongue into her mouth, Cali awkwardly tries to accustom to the new experience. As she passively responds back to your kisses, you begin to strip her clothes from her.\n\nAs her body becomes exposed, Cali blushes even harder, which quite contrasts with her usual cheeky attitude. Noticing you closely inspecting her, wolfgirl meekly speaks.\n\n[color=yellow]— Uhm... sorry, for not being much to look at. [/color]\n\nRealizing, that she mistook your actions, you quickly reassure her, that you are quite happy with her form. Trusting your words, she succumbs as you push young girl down and go over her chest with your mouth. Cali puts up minor resistance by putting her hands over your head as you tease and gently bite the aroused nipples of her nearly flat chest. As she begin to acclimatise to the new sensations, her breathing gets accompanied by meek moans. You attempt to place your hand over her crotch only to realize it's been covered by her bushy tail. Getting past that, you confirm she's already wet. After pushing her tail aside and taking a look at her tight virgin slit, as she dazedly watches you inspect her, you decide that it's time.\n\n"
var CaliProposalSexMale = "After preemptively warning her, you pull out your already rock-hard cock, which she observes in awe, and position it over her pussy. As you take her hands into yours and take in her face, she gives you a broad, ready smile. Taking the opportunity you forcefully penetrate her in one quick thrust. With her hymen torn, her incredibly tight pussy willingly takes your cock inside eased by its wetness. Cali's pained cry briefly fills the room, calming down as your minor pain-absorption spell makes her feel better. While still connected, you hug and kiss the wolfgirl to which she reacts almost blissfully. After explaining to her that you’re going to move now, and getting a confirming nod back, you begin to slowly move in and out of her tight hole. \n\nAlmost forgetting about the recent pain, Cali seems to focus on you and your movements, trying to adapt her little body to your pushes. The wolfgirl's pussy seems to be getting better at taking your cock with each thrust making her moan in pleasure. Each thrust feels like you’re shaping her recently virgin slit into your new personal hole. As pleasure overwhelms her, you set yourself to trying to cum in unison, increasing your speed almost neglecting her small stature. Finally feeling the approaching orgasm, you seal her lips with one last passionate smooch. As you fill her womb with your hot seed, you can feel her inner walls tightly spasm around you due to her own climax. After couple of moments lying breathless on Cali, you finally pull out letting seed flow from her.\n\n[color=yellow]— I'm really glad you was my first, $name. That felt amazing... can we do it again some other time?[/color]\n\nShe looks a bit puzzled as you laugh in response, but still hugs and affectionately kisses you. Still naked you both fall asleep. "
var CaliDenyProposal = "You give Cali's head a gentle pat and say, that you also like her and you will be watching out for her, until her parents are found. She shows relief, but you can spot a disappointed tone in her reaction."

Bet you are disappointed, hehe, but I'm part of the establishment. You want to know more about fairies like me? They are fairly rare and expensive. If captured from the wild, they require complex training to be able to serve on par with other slaves, so usually rich people buy them for their exotic value. I've been educated and trained since very young age, so I guess that would make me pretty expensive! *giggles*\n\n— Yeah.. you could try your luck outside near the elven and far parts of the local forest. Wild fairies can occasionally be met there, but capturing them is on you. Be careful, I will be sad if something bad happens to you, $name![/color]"

This time we have an actual issue on our hands. As you know, the Order takes care of all sorts of political disputes around for the benefit of kingdom. How do you feel about travelling to one of the hotter regions? We received a request for help from the Orc's capital, Gorn. \n\n— Apparently, there's some local disputes we have been asked to solve by one of the councils in government. Surely, you should be able to take care of that. Just one suggestion, try to keep low profile and not disclose who you are while working on it. Not everyone is happy to have the Order directly involved in what they consider their own business. When you get there, look for orc named Garthor from the Sorgul clan. Help him out with this, then come see me. Later. [/color]"
var MainQuestGornPalace = "You make your way to the biggest and cleanest building in the city, The Palace, quietly passing the guards by presenting your badge. Shortly thereafter, you manage to locate Garthor. Despite his mildly savage look, his composure carries an indication of  maturity and seriousness. He invites you into a relatively small room where you can talk in private. \n\n[color=yellow]— Greetings, $name. Melissa told me, that you will be helping out with our small problem. [/color]\n\nThe Orc gives you brief summary regarding a large dark elf clan called Kel'tor located to the east, and while nominally neutral to Gorn, has recently been taken control of by ambitious young elf with unclear motives named Ivran. His informant however suggests, that Ivran is potentially very dangerous and the recent course of Kel'tor seems to suggest more aggression towards the surrounding areas. In either case Garthor wants you to capture and bring him in for interrogation. After that a decision will be need to be made on what to do with him. Infiltration of their lands won't likely bear any fruit as they are extremely suspect of strangers. \n\nYou are given a full estimated schedule of Ivran and it's clear that capturing him around evening on the hunting fields which he regularly visits might be the only option to catch him with the fewest guards possible. "
var MainQuestGornIvranFind = "After some time scouting you manage to spot Ivran resting in a camp surrounded by his men after the hunt. The dark skinned elven male has a very slender, almost feminine figure and somewhat delicate face, making you wonder how valuable he might be if not for situation. Their hunting seems to have taken them further from their settlements, so there shouldn't be any reinforcements if you strike now. "
var MainQuestGornIvranWin = "Despite Ivran’s men trying their best to protect him from your assault, you take him captive. With some of them retreating and likely calling for help as fight started, you decide a quick withdrawal is in order.You blindfold and tie the elf then make your way back to Garthor. \n\nThankfully, city guards let you in without question and the appointed person leads you to Garthor. He seems quite pleased with your work and tells you to return in few days, once they have managed to get some information out of your captive. "
var MainQuestGornPalaceReturn = "You make your way back to Garthor, who apparently has been waiting for your arrival. After a brief greeting, he tells you that Ivran was planning to begin actively moving against Gorn's government and were in position to attack the city. Obviously, his existence endangers too many people, so we can't let him leave now. However what to do about him is left for you to decide. "
var MainQuestGornIvranExecute = "Garthor gives you a nod and says that Ivran will be quietly disposed of. He passes you the letter and explains that this is a message to your boss indicating that you have completed your job.. He expresses his gratitude and hopes to work with your again some future day."
var MainQuestGornIvranImprison = "Garthor gives a slight frown, but agrees and tells you, that Ivran will be kept in his personal cells. He passes you the letter and explains that this is a message to your boss. He expresses his gratitude and hopes to work with your again some future day."
var MainQuestGornAydaSolo = "\n\nAs you are about to leave, Garthor stops you and passes you a small note. He explains, that there's an independant alchemist in city which you might be interested in, and that he wants to thank you at least minorly by providing this acquaintance. "
var MainQuestGornIvranKeep = "Garthor says that this is too dangerous to keep elf free and alive. Even if you brainwash him, he might recover his memories and try rejoin his clan creating even more problems in the long run. However, after some thought, he writes you a letter and asks you to pass it along to specific alchemist and researcher, who is a friend of his and might be able to come up with something if you insist on taking possession of Ivran.

Thankfully they will provide necessary support for free, so without further delay you pass the potion to Garthor.\n\nAfter about an hour they bring you a cuffed dark elf girl, who has already undergone all the changes. She is still quite lean and undeniably attractive. Without knowing who she was, it would be very hard to draw the connection between two. Lastly, Garthor passes you the letter to be handled to your boss and sends you on your way. After returning to your mansion, you decide it's a good time to give her a new name:"

So you are the one who took care of that issue. The letter told me you are looking into ways to take care of Ivran and want me to provide assistance with making him... harmless. I guess, I can provide you with one, unconventional method. You could turn him into a gal, I heard he's already somewhat of effeminate looks, so you will get yourself a new plaything. This is not your average body modification however, and the effects won't be reversible. Dark elven clans are strict and patriarchal, so even if he was able to prove that he's their old leader, it's nearly guaranteed they won't follow after him. That should be sufficient for your plans?\n\n— I will want you to help me out first though. I gather you have enough connections and power to provide me with a part-time worker?

Here, take your reward, you earned it. I wish I could also reward you with some time off, but a fairly urgent matter has arisen. With your recent accomplishments and dedication I would rather entrust it to you, than another.\n\n— Are you familiar with Amberguard? It's an old elven town located to the East of Wimborn. Unlike many of the wandering elves you might have seen about, those who live there prefer to have a little to do with us as possible. However, they do still obey and follow the rules of  the Order so you should not encounter any problems travelling  there. They probably won't act very friendly, Be that as it may, I believe you will manage.\n\n— A short distance North of Amberguard, you will find one of the entrances to an old  underground tunnel system. The entrance was sealed away by the elves hundreds of years ago. An informant of mine reports that the entrance appears to have been sealed in haste and it is very likely that there may be ancient relics as well as documents containing important and valuable knowledge left behind in those tunnels.\n\n— As you might have guessed, outwardly your mission seems pretty straight forward when put into words, heh. Find a way into those tunnels, find out what’s in them and bring back whatever you find. \n\n— It’s going to be harder than that though. Those tunnels were sealed for a reason, what that is I don’t know but I expect it could be rather dangerous, so I would take as many combat capable escorts as I could if I were you. \n\n— See you later, Oh and  $name, keep this mission and whatever you find on the down-low for now.[/color] "

Quickly picking up on your confused look  he gives you a brief summary of the subject. In recent months there  have been a number of  rumors regarding  an individual calling himself Hade, who has been interfering in guild business and we believe attempting to recruiting members of order. Outside of few unexplained deaths and disappearances suspected to be linked to him there is almost nothing to go on. Moreover, the Senate does not believe that anyone would be able to, or have the audacity to willingly disrupt or even oppose the entire Order so they discard those reports as meaningless rumors as there simply is not sufficient evidence to prove anything.\n\nWith that, he expresses his respect for your hard work and dedication, as well as congratulating you on  your recent achievements and quick promotions. He asks you  to contact him should you come across any information or encounter something suspicious that may be related to Hade. After leaving you with his coordinates and a reminder that Hade is potentially a rather dangerous individual, David disappears into the ancillary portal room."

A lean looking man stands in the shadows.\n\nBeckoning for you to come over he makes you an offer. He might know someone who knows how to enter the tunnels but it’s going to cost you for the information.\n\n[color=yellow]— You look like the type of person who can afford it. 1000 gold and the information is all yours.

From what I have learnt within the tunnels used to be a human city, which was destroyed during the events of the Great War, now all that is left are ruins. Maybe some magic experiment went out of control, maybe destructive elven magic. Not gonna make blind assumptions, but I'd imagine tens of thousands died and were left there. On top of that, leftover magic has polluted much of the area.. \n\n— I believe at some point, it became so bad, they decided to seal whole thing underground. It was most likely too late though and some of the pollution affected the surrounding areas. You should be familiar with what sort of things happen around magic pollution. I've tried to find more info about it, but the Order seems to have patiently cleaned up everything after war ended and access to a lot of information is restricted.

I'm mostly interested in using them for my experiments. Mostly... I want you to bring me one elf and one drow. I am studying the differences between them and it's hard to find willing folks for my experiments. That, and drow are simply not common in these parts. \n\n— Bring me both and I'll get you underground. [/color]"
var MainQuestAmberguardSlaveDeliver = "[color=yellow]— Alright, I'll take those. Now I'll tell you how to get in. \n\n— Yeah, there's no point trying to unseal main entrance, since that would require a lot of effort and there are simpler ways to get in. Many creatures have tunneled holes to get in and out, not to mention there are a number of caves that have openings. I'll tell you how to get there, but be prepared, I don't think there is much in there that  wouldn't try cut or bite your face off around that place. [/color]"

var AmberguardShuriyaVisit = "You enter a fairly spacious and cozy, if messy, house. The shelves and tables are piled high and  cluttered with various scrolls, potions and herbs, leaving very little empty space. With your experience you notice an unusually high amount of raw magic in the air. The female drow turns to addresses you, indicating that your presence hasn't disturbed her.\n\n[color=yellow]— You can call me Shuriya. Don't pay mind to the folk who call me  a witch or something like that. I just prefer solitary life and a quiet place to dabble in alchemy a bit. Nothing of concern, unless the Order has now outlawed that too?\n\n—  So, what brings you all the way out here?[/color]"
var AmberguardLog1 = "[center]Guard Officer Log[/center]\nWithin the ruins of an old watchtower you find the burnt remains of a journal. Most of the pages crumble at your touch. Of those that remain only a few remain comprehensible.\n\n5pm. The recon team has just returned from their mission. Surprisingly, they seem to be eager to make their report. After leaving their horses in the stables, they quickly made their way to the central command. Hopefully, today's mission has born fruit.\n\n6:45 pm.The enemy has been spotted around the city's outskirts. An unusually swift attack by them has been stopped by the numerous traps placed around the town. There is no sign of them giving up and more attacks are expected at any time.I sent a request for immediate support and yet another one few minutes ago, but I'm afraid we won't be able to hold for long.\n\n6:00 am. The assault has continued throughout the night, we received reinforcements in time allowing us to force the elves from a breach and seal it. We may holdout still."
var AmberguardLog2 = "[center]City Commander Log[/center]\nToday's mission is of utmost importance, our recon team will be infiltrating the enemy's latest research lab. Our  spies report that there is potentially a vital piece of research that may change the balance of the war. They also provided a one-chance route to get in and retrieve it with relative safety. I can only hope this is not a trap, but the reward far outweighs the risk. This war has been going on long enough and any potential breakthrough will help to save thousands of lives.\n\n…\n\nThe recon team has returned a couple of minutes ago, I've sent them directly onto the Order. As usual the elves have been extremely cautious and protected their discoveries with magic, but it shouldn't be a problem for the Order's decryptors.\n\n…\n\nThe Elves have attacked and this time they came close to destroying the outer wall. The city has been surrounded, the elves moving in shortly after the first strikes. I've managed to send a messenger through their lines to the nearest town. Given how relentlessly they are proceeding with the siege, we may be able to hold out a few days at best. There's no doubt that this strike is retaliation for what we stole from them.\n\n…\n\nThey are relentless, most would have retreated and settled in for an extended siege by now but they keep throwing bodies at the wall. They must be desperate to retrieve our findings. This gives us hope that what we have is even more vital to our survival and we thought."
var AmberguardLog3 = "[center]Order Master Log[/center]\nAfter all the setbacks we have faced, we’ve finally done it. We have in our hands the solution to ending the war. The Thaumic Obstructor can easily affect an area roughly a square mile and is especially effective against those who are magically gifted targets. It's ironic, how they were the ones who designed this device. Once we get through scheme's encryption and defences, we'll be able to develop additional protection for ourselves and render whole squads of theirs ineffective.\n\nIt is clear enough that they are well aware that we were stole their schematics and are launching ferocious attacks against our outposts already. Thankfully we  prepared for such, and as a result they have suffered a great number of casualties. It is vital that we pass on our findings to the other members of the Order and to the rest of humanity. As long as we have enough time, we should be able to get word out. \n\nMiraculously our walls still stand. Reports from the walls report the elves have retreated back to a safe distance but still surround the city. I do not for one minute think this is over. Too much is at stake."

var GornAydaTalk = "[color=yellow]— I don't really care about what's going on around as long as I'm safe and nobody interrupts my works. Alchemy is just something I do so the Palace will play along with my demands and nobody pushes me around for not obeying the authority and traditions, marrying some imbecile because that's what dark elf women do, or whatever. \n\n— In case you were wondering, I'm actually far more interested in species researches. Life and sentience took very broad way to present itself and that has amused me for a very long time, so with some extra help I'm able to roam around and gather lots of information. Very few people actually care about things like history or how everything came to be as it is now, but at least some might find my works helpful in the future. [/color]"
var GornAydaTalkMonsters = "[color=yellow]— Oh yeah, I've been studying the less humanoid races and their behavior. It's nothing surprising really: people can only rise from community of other people. The more primitive the community, the less children are able to adapt, so in some cases even the ability to talk is a lot to ask. This is more a young brain's ability to learn much more at earlier stages, so a grown-up entity will have incredible hardships adapting to more complex society. \n\n— I've found only one solution to this - reverse an entity's mind back to its' very young stage, retrieving back the ability to adapt to new surroundings. This is not the most elegant solution, but if you really someone to be able to not freak out in a city, that will probably be your only solution. I can sell you the recipe, but that won't be cheap. \n\n— As for re-education I suggest you see the slaver's guild. As far as I know, they do have some specifically designed schools at least around human dominated cities.[/color]"
